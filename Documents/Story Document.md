I'm writing a proper story and campaign. This is my first draft. Analyze and propose.

Influences:

Parasite Eve, David Lynch, Junji Ito, The X-Files, PSX-era Persona, SCP Foundation.


Setting: São Paulo, 1999. 
INTRA (Instituto de Rastreamento de Anomalias) is a small, ill-equipped but well connected antigovernment organization that investigates and unfolds a dark mystery. (Thematic parallels: The X-Files, SCP Foundation, Parasite Eve 2's MIST)
A direct counter to the references' tendency to portray the Police positively - The Police (and the Government) are active antagonists, agents of oppression.
(even if not all people mobilized into these offices are bad), and the narrative is aware of that. 
The police may seem 'bureaucratic and inefficient' to some, but to others, they're brutal - they're lethal. And structurally so. This is backed by Brazil's recurring cases in favelas,
as well as unattended domestic violence (nuanced totally differently and also perversely when men are the victim), systemic racism, homophobia, transphobia etc. 
For all of these reasons and more, the party and the Police (as representatives of an oppressive, even if amicable in comparison to the preceding dictatorship) are at fundamental odds. 

Flavor: 
Story / Characters often remind the player we are in 1999. It's the year where "the world will end". Some mock it as nonsense, some believe it, but it is a recurring topic.
It's 1999. NPCs and news articles comment on FHC's current mandate, and Lula's proposals. 
This feels very nostalgic and even unsettling - Lula is the president that has had the most time in office in recent brazilian history. 
Reframing him as a "candidate" and "alternative" in texture and lore firmly grounds the setting in a Brazil that's decades removed from current time.
ESPECIALLY considering the current political climate.
References to lacking metro/subway stations that nowdays do exist (such as the Butantã station)


Characters:

1. Julia dos Santos (23, F) (no nickname. People don't call her nicknames. Only her older brother did)
A young, no bullshit agent at a countergovernment organization. 
Background: 
When she was 8, she witnessed the brutal murder of her older brother in a police raid. Her mother is a shut-in. 
Her high school best friend is now a devout evangelical police officer; she misses him.
Attachment Style: Dismissive-avoidant. (Why? How? Let's elaborate.)

2. Miguel (36, M)
A soft, gentle but quirky man who, despite his age, has experienced very little in life. 
Background: 
Has a huge crush on his boss, who is his childhood friend. Tends to crush on other men easily, something which Julia teases him for.
His crush (and unresolved romantic tension) with his boss remains a firm theme in all endings. 
Notoriously Rebus is not his type, but that doesn't stop him from developing a minor crush anyway. This resolves rapidly.

Attachment Style: Anxious.

3. Rebus (??, M)
A beautiful, androgynous man with no memory and no ID. The organization has found him. 
Rebus isn’t a person but a “pattern” that keeps reincarnating in different hosts; the more the org investigates, the more real he becomes.
This resonates with my views on human intesubjectivity, as well as Lucia Santaella's Semiotics work.
Is an immediate "tag along" party member, from the first VR mission. His more attuned "powers" make him the glass cannon of the group.

4. Olavo (35, M) 
Handles missions to the duo - the trio, as soon Rebus becomes an official tag along member.
Miguel's childhood friend.

Locations:
ALL locations in this game (with the exception of the VELDT, which is not technically a location anyway) are real world locations in São Paulo or Santos.
Story needs to allow these locations to be representative of roguelike, procedurally generated, combat dungeons. 
The SCP Foundation / X-Files influence is perfect for this: Dungeons are usually tied to a monster of the week case the party is investigating (until the very end).
So, a "mission system" is also important - each mission is tied to a thematically diverse "SCP-XXXX-XX"-like entry
Enemies fought in combat are never humans; they range from the disgusting rats of Parasite Eve to demons of Megami Ibunraku Persona.
This means relying on the player's suspension of disbelief, sure, but it also needs to be grounded in recognizable tropes.


0. Base: The organization's base of operations. Where you'll usually return to after every mission. 
It's possible to buy items, upgrade equipment and handle character progression from here.

1. VELDT: The first dungeon, and the only one that remains available/replayable for the entirety of the game. It updates according to story and gameplay progression 
(mechanically, this allows the player to interact with data that would be gated off by story otherwise.)
Story-wise and visually, it's a "VR Simulation" at the org's facility that the agents use to train when not on mission.
"Corrupted Simulation" is a corny theme I would not like to approach. Maybe it can be Discussed, Teased, but is ultimately completely Averted. 

(Not in order:)
?. Santa Casa Da Misericórdia De Santos:
Themes: Body horror, pregnancy, loss. The party eventually accesses the morgue as well. 
?. USP
?. The subway should be a visitable location.
?. ...9 total dungeons. 3 are optional. 

Endings: 

1. Bad Ending:
The player never unfolds the mystery. The final boss is a random monster of the week. 

2. Normal Ending: 
In the second to last dungeon, Rebus is separated from the party.
Rebus's role in the story solidifies as antagonistic and monstruous - a real, immediate and high stakes threat scenario. Mass evacuation level. "1999 apocalypse" level.
Rebus is truly a chilling being, and framed as the true villain, narratively.
There are hints of the TRUE ending and this not being the case, for the observant player.
The final boss is Rebus, with Julia and Miguel kill him and close the case.

3. TRUE ending: 
The player unfolds the mystery. The fight with Rebus is relentless: Rebus is unbeatable and wipes the party.
Control switches to Rebus, the game behaves as if the mission was a success.
At this point, Rebus Can still return to Base. He will have to deal with explaining the abscence of Julia and Miguel when interacting with NPCs.
One TRUE final dungeon opens up, which the player plays as Rebus . Important: THIS MUST BE A REAL PLACE.
During the dungeon, after a few floors, Julia and Miguel rejoin him in preparation for a climactic final battle.

4. JOKE Ending: 
Only attainable on a NG+. Think UFO Ending on Silent Hill.



Notes:

-1999 is the year of the apocalypse. This is a strong thematic pull for drama and stakes. Imagery of solar eclipse.

-Show how knowledge production is itself a battleground. The horror, instead of superficially¹ biological as in Parasite Eve, is fully cognitive. 
¹This is implied in Parasite Eve, as well! Cognition is nothing without biology.

-Just like how biology precedes cognition in Parasite Eve (and results in a horror that is fundamentally cognitive), cognition precedes biology and reality in SP1999. 
Abominations and "magic-like" effects represent this, thematically and, more importantly, for genre-adherence and cohesion. (Such as who you actually Fight.)

-Intersubjectivity, separation of self and other, multiplicity of self (which includes the existence of as many 'mental models' of self as there are others that cognize us), 
understanding of 'reality' as a fragile concept, isolation of self (as an "impenetrable" barrier prevents direct consciousness to consciousness contact - communication demands translation and intersemiology)
This is a strong theme in: Silent Hill, Persona, Neon Genesis Evangelion. 



-Themes and phrases that are BANNED from the game:
"People’s memories glitch" - no. 
Time Travel / Layers of time collapsing - no.
