I'm writing a proper story and campaign. This is my first draft. Analyze and propose.

Influences:

Parasite Eve, David Lynch, Junji Ito, The X-Files, PSX-era Persona, SCP Foundation.


Setting: São Paulo, 1999. 
A small, ill-equipped but well connected antigovernment organization investigates and unfolds a dark mystery. 
A direct counter to the references' tendency to portray the Police positively. In this story, The Police (and the Government) are active antagonists, agents of oppression
(even if not all people mobilized into these offices are bad), and the narrative is aware of that. 

Flavor: 
Story / Characters often remind the player we are in 1999. NPCs and news articles comment on FHC's current mandate, and Lula's proposals. 
This feels very nostalgic and even unsettling - Lula is the president that has had the most time in office in recent brazilian history. 
Reframing him as a "candidate" and "alternative" in texture and lore firmly grounds the setting in a Brazil that's decades removed from current time.
ESPECIALLY considering the current political climate.
References to lacking metro/subway stations that nowdays do exist (such as the Butantã station)

Characters:

1."????" (23, F) 
A young, no bullshit agent at a countergovernment organization. 
Attachment Style: Distant.

2. "????" (36, M) 
A soft, gentle but quirky man who, despite his age, has experienced very little in life. 
Has a huge crush on his boss, who is his childhood friend. Tends to crush on other men easily, something which 1. teases him for. 
3. is notoriously "not his type", but that doesn't stop him from developing a minor crush anyway.

Attachment Style: Anxious.

3. "????" (??, M)
A beautiful, androgynous man with no memory and no ID. The organization has found him. 
3 isn’t a person but a “pattern” that keeps reincarnating in different hosts; the more the org investigates, the more real he becomes.
This resonates with my views on human intesubjectivity, as well as Lucia Santaella's Semiotics work.


Locations:

0. Base: The organization's base of operations. Where you'll usually return to after every mission. 
It's possible to buy items, upgrade equipment and handle character progression from here.

1. VELDT: The first dungeon, and the only one that remains available/replayable for the entirety of the game. It updates according to story and gameplay progression 
(mechanically, this allows the player to interact with data that would be gated off by story otherwise.)
Story-wise and visually, it's a "VR Simulation" at the org's facility that the agents use to train when not on mission.
"Corrupted Simulation" is a corny theme I would not like to approach. Maybe it can be lampshaded or subverted. 

2. ???

3. Santa Casa Da Misericórdia De Santos:

4. USP

?. The subway should be a visitable location.

Endings: 

1. Bad Ending:
The player never unfolds the mystery. The final boss is a random monster of the week. 

2. Normal Ending: 
In the second to last dungeon, 3. is separated from the party. 
3's role in the story solidifies as antagonistic and monstruous. 3. is truly a chilling being, and framed as the true villain, narratively. 
There are hints of the TRUE ending and this not being the case, for the observant player.
The final boss is 3., with 1. and 2. kill him and close the case.

3. TRUE ending: 
The player unfolds the mystery. The fight with 3. is relentless: 3. is unbeatable and wipes the party. 
Control switches to 3., the game behaves as if the mission was a success. 
3. Can still return to Base. The NPCs will note the abscence of 1. and 2.
One TRUE final dungeon opens up, which the player plays as 3.
During the dungeon, after a few floors, 1. and 2. rejoin him in preparation for a climactic final battle.
