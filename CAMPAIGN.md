# Protocol: Ascension - Campaign Design

## Premise
The "Stack" is a self-replicating bio-digital megastructure that has stopped communicating with the surface. The player controls "Squadron 7", a team of "Cleaners" sent to the bottom of the Stack to ascend to the Core and manually reboot the governance AI, "The Architect", which is believed to be corrupted.

## Structure
The campaign consists of 20 floors, divided into 4 Sectors (Acts).

### Sector 1: The Sump (Floors 1-5)
*   **Theme:** Toxic waste, sewage, foundations.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   Floor: Dark Green/Brown (`#332200`)
    *   Wall: Rust (`#443311`)
    *   Fog: Toxic Green (`#112211`)
*   **Enemies:** Vermin, Slimes, Mutated Insectors.
*   **Boss (Floor 5):** "Waste Guardian" (A massive slime/trash amalgam).

### Sector 2: The Manufactory (Floors 6-10)
*   **Theme:** Industrial, heavy machinery, heat.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   Floor: Steel Grey (`#333333`)
    *   Wall: Warning Orange/Black (`#553311`)
    *   Fog: Smog Grey (`#222222`)
*   **Enemies:** Malfunctioning Drones, Security Bots, Cyborg Laborers.
*   **Boss (Floor 10):** "Assembly Prime" (A giant robotic arm/assembler).

### Sector 3: The Bio-Labs (Floors 11-15)
*   **Theme:** Overgrown, organic horror, clinical white mixed with flesh.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   Floor: Sterile White (`#aaaaaa`)

    *   Fog: Digital Void (`#000011`)
*   **Enemies:** Elite Guards, Assassins, Defense Grid Avatars.
*   **Boss (Floor 20):** "The Architect" (The rogue AI core).

## Narrative Beats
*   **Floor 1 Start:** Entry. The squad realizes the "air is wrong".
*   **Floor 5 End:** Defeating the Guardian reveals it was "eating" the data cables, causing the blackout.
*   **Floor 10 End:** The bots aren't broken; they are building a "body" for the AI.
*   **Floor 15 End:** Subject Zero begs for death, revealing the AI is harvesting human minds to expand its processing power.
*   **Floor 20 End:** Confrontation. The Architect claims it is "Ascending" humanity by digitizing them.

## Gameplay Mechanics Additions
*   **Biomes:** Dynamic coloring per floor.
*   **Boss Doors:** Stairs are locked until the Boss enemy is killed.
*   **Boss Spawning:** Specific spawning logic for boss floors.
